## Getting Started

To get started with the code, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rakibhhridoy/PredictingSequence-TimeSeriesAnalysis.git](https://github.com/rakibhhridoy/PredictingSequence-TimeSeriesAnalysis.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a chapter directory:**
    ```bash
    cd PredictingSequence-TimeSeriesAnalysis
    ```
3.  **Install the necessary libraries:**
    (It's recommended to use a virtual environment)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # (assuming a requirements.txt exists in each chapter or root)
    ```
    *If a `requirements.txt` is not provided, you might need to install libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `scikit-learn`, `pmdarima`, `statsmodels`, `prophet` manually.*
4.  **Open and run the Jupyter notebooks:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
